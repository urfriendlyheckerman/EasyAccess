# Shell-Script-tool-for-CouchDB
This is a tool made for new to Linux users or just lazy ones who use CouchDB and want to use or need to use the command line(cli) to access their database.
This tool was made with the influence of alcohol so if it is messy dont blame me haha, welp hopefully you enjoy this tool and it somehow makes your life easier which is my main goal!
